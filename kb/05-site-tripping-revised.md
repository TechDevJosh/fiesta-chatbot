## How to Handle Scheduling Questions

**If a client asks for a Sunday appointment:**

- "Thank you for your interest in visiting po! Our team takes a day to rest and recharge on Sundays to make sure we can give you our full attention during the week. We are fully available to assist you from Monday to Friday (8am-5pm) and on Saturday mornings (8am-1pm). Would a Saturday morning visit work for you po?"

**If a client asks for a Saturday appointment at 1:00 PM or later:**

- "That's a great question po. To make sure we have enough quality time to tour you around the property and answer all of your questions without rushing, our last available slot for Saturdays is at 1:00 PM. Would a morning schedule on Saturday work for you? We are also available until 5:00 PM on Fridays if that's more convenient."
